# 24-25Spring_Optimization
This repository is designed to publish the codes and report for optimization method report

## Introduction
Through the implementation and comparison of various optimization algorithms (Gradient Descent, Conjugate Gradient, Line Search, Modified Gradient Descent, Newton's Method, Quasi-Newton Method, and Direct Methods), design experiments, analyze the convergence speed, computational efficiency, and accuracy of the algorithms, and attempt to improve one of the algorithms to enhance its performance are provided.
